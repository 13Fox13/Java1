    The solution is to be written using Java 1.8 only, external libraries are forbidden. 
    You can add dependencies with scope "test" if it's needed to write new unit-tests.
    The exam includes 3 tasks to be done: Calculator, Pyramid, and Subsequence.

Task 1. Calculator

Write a calculator for evaluating arithmetic expressions.
An expression can consist of:Digits (0-9); Dots as decimal marks (valid example: 100.02, not valid example : 100..02); Parentheses
Mathematical symbols (allowed are : "+", "-", "*", "/"); Rounding is to be performed to 4 significant digits, only the final result is to be rounded.

Task 2. Pyramid builder

Your solution should build a pyramid from given input list of integer values. Numbers are to be sorted ascending from top to bottom, from left to right.
Empty spaces are to be filled with zeros. In order to make the pyramid symmetric input numbers should alternate with zeros.

Task 3. Subsequence

Given two sequences {X} and {Y} of arbitrary elements (java.lang.Object).
Determine whether {X} can be built by removing some elements from {Y} without changing the order.
